When tragedy strikes her personal life, Anna, desperate and numb, flees to the Northern California village of Mendocino to grieve. She lived there as a child with her beloved foster parents, and now she believes it might be the only place left for her. Yet the day she arrives, she learns a local teenage girl has gone missing. The crime feels frighteningly reminiscent of the most crucial time in Anna's childhood, when the unsolved murder of a young girl touched Mendocino and changed the community forever.\n\nAs past and present collide, Anna realizes that she has been led to this moment. The most difficult lessons of her life have given her insight into how victims come into contact with violent predators. As Anna becomes obsessed with the missing girl, she must accept that true courage means getting out of her own way and learning to let others in.\n\nWeaving together actual cases of missing persons, trauma theory, and a hint of the metaphysical, this propulsive and deeply affecting novel tells a story of fate, necessary redemption, and what it takes, when the worst happens, to reclaim our lives--and our faith in one another.\n\nFrom the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Paris Wife</i> comes a novel of intertwined destinies and heart-wrenching suspense: A detective hiding away from the world.

But you have a great motivation working for you, which is your desire for happiness. I define happiness as the state of fulfillment, and everyone wants to be fulfilled.

An estimated 250 million fetal ultrasound examinations are performed every year in the USA.

Number-oriented examples and exercises have been replaced with data- oriented exercises. Topics are presented in the order needed to build increasingly sophisticated data analysis solutions. Some topics like try and except are pulled forward and presented as part of the chapter on conditionals. Functions are given very light treatment until they are needed to handle program complexity rather than introduced as an early lesson in abstraction. Nearly all user-defined functions have been removed from the example code and exercises outside of Chapter 4. The word “recursion”1 does not appear in the book at all.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"12,00","Categories > Textbook","Computer, Data, Programming, Python, Science",,https://decentreads-ec1e60.ingress-florina.ewp.live/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/9781530051120.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,default,default,default,default,default,set,uag-css-147.css,,,,
